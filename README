## Overview

This is an Arduino library which implements the HDMI v1.3a CEC wire protocol which allows communication with HDMI CEC capable devices. A typical usage scenario would be a Home Theater PC environment which uses HDMI but does not support CEC. This would allow the HTPC to communicate with other HDMI CEC equipment.

## Circuit

See schematic posted at https://code.google.com/p/cec-arduino/wiki/ElectricalInterface
